The proof is based on the continuation theorem in the absence of a priori bounds given by \textit{A. Capietto}, \textit{J. Mawhin} and \textit{F. Zanolin} [J. Differ.

Beginning with the definition of Mahler's measure, he touches on Lehmer's problem, Smyth's theorem for non-reciprocal polynomials, explicit formulas for multivariable Mahler measures and the appearance of the Mahler measure as the entropy of certain \(\mathbb Z^n\) actions on compact abelian groups. He then turns to the elliptic Mahler measure, as recently defined by the author and \textit{B. Fhlathúin} [Math. Proc. Camb. Philos. Soc. 120, 13-25 (1996; Zbl 0865.11068)], and explains in simple terms the analogy with the classical Mahler measure and the connection of this new measure with the canonical height on elliptic curves. He ends with 5 open problems (one of which is Lehmer's problem). Some recent progress on problem number 3 has been made by \textit{Hubert Bornhorn} [Thesis, Univ. Münster (1999)] and \textit{F. Rodriguez Villegas} [Proceedings of the International number theory conference, Penn. State University (August 1997)].","['11R09', '11R06', '32A15', '11R06', '11C08', '11R09', '12D10']"
